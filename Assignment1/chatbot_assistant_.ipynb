        "- **Tasks:** Chunk input (e.g. RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter), generate embeddings (OpenAIEmbeddings or Sentence Transformers), store in a vector store (e.g. FAISS), prompt the LLM to use retrieval as knowledge.\n",
        "- **Extra (conversational):** User can ask follow-ups; e.g. \"I want to purchase an iPhone\" → system lists iPhone 13, 14, 15 → user asks \"What is the price of the oldest one\" and the system should understand that means the oldest of those (e.g. iPhone 13) without the user re-typing.\n",

They're pretty much all separated by $100, but there are some interesting overlaps. So, the iPhone 16E is the budget offering on the iPhone lineup at $599. Going up $100, you have the iPhone 16 from last year. Still a really solid phone, but there's some differences between the new generation and last year. You also have the iPhone 16 Plus, which is just a larger version of the iPhone 16. So, for the purposes of this video, I'll mostly just be showing the iPhone 16 in camera test and stuff like that, but just know the difference is going to be in the display size. Now, the iPhone 16 Plus is $799, which is the same price as the iPhone 17. Then, the iPhone Air is $1,000. So, that one jumps up $200 to $9.99. The iPhone 17 Pro is [...] So, that one jumps up $200 to $9.99. The iPhone 17 Pro is another $100 more expensive at $1,99. And the Pro Max is another $100 at $1199. Now, the Pro and Pro Max are essentially identical as well, aside from the 6.3 in versus 6.9 in display and of course the larger battery associated with the larger phone, which gives you about 39 versus 33 hours of playback. It's an extra $100, but other than that, they're identical phones. So, again, for the purposes of this video, so we're not talking about seven different phones, they're the same phone, and I'll just be talking about the Pro throughout this video. Just know the Pro and the Pro Max are really the same phone. Now, I'll try to tag all of these below with YouTube shopping so you can see the latest prices.
